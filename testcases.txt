Create index:


    WORKS:
        create index on an existing table with an existing column with no previous indices with the same name   
            and previous index on the column
        create index on table that doesnt exist should throw an error
        create index on column that doesnt exist should throw an error
        create index on column that already has an index should throw an error
        create index with an already existing index name should throw an error
    DOESN'T:




Insert into table:
    WORKS:
        Insert with already existing primary key should throw error
        insert to table that doesnt exist should throw error
        insert with missing values should throw error
        insert tuple with a new primary key-->works when validInsert is removed
        insert with incompatible data types should throw error ------> name doesnt give error when not string-->fixed
    DOESN'T:


Update Table:
    WORKS:
        Id not integer throws an error
        table not present should throw an error
        primary key present in values to update should throw an error -------->not needed
        incompatible data types should throw an error -------------> String Name doesnt work--->fixed


    DOESN'T:

Delete from Table:

    WORKS:
        Deleting tuple with a single criteria
        Deleting tuple with mor than one criteria
        table not present should throw an error
        incompatible data types should throw an error
        incompatible Column name should throw an error
        Delete with index uses index correctly and works correctly -----> fixed
        Deleting multiple tuples ------->fixed
        delete without index works correctly

    DOESN'T:

Select from Table:
    WORKS:
        Different table names in sql terms array should throw an error
        wrong amount of sql terms/operators throws an error

        wrong operator used should throw an error 
        no sql terms should throws an error --->fixed
        select works with multiple terms and operators ---->fixed
        Problem: XOR doesn't delete existing items ----->fixed
        select with index uses index correctly and works correctly 
        select without index Cases -------> all fixed:
            - 2 ANDs, 3 terms 
            - AND,OR, 3 terms ---------->fixed
            - 2 ORs, 3 terms ----------->fixed
            - 2 XOR/AND, XOR, 3 terms ---> XOR doesnt remove existing results from previous operations  ----->fixed
