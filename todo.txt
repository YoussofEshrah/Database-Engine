Table Class:
    DONE    Find out what attributes should be stored in the table class
    DONE    Fix implementation of pagesList (should be referencing page names)
    DONE    Check implementation of locating page for insert (whether or not to do it linearly or using binary 
            search and min max values)
    DONE    Fix updateTuple it takes string value not object and we dont handle that
    DONE    binary search for updateTuple method in Page


Page Class: 
    DONE    Review instance variables of Page class (especially strClusteringKey)
    DONE    Review all of Page class
    DONE    Use min and max after inserts and deletions(BIG ISSUE ON DELETIONS HERE)
    DONE    Fix toString() of Page
    DONE    Fix updateTuple it takes string value not object and we dont handle that


B+Tree Class:
    DONE    modify delete method in index to delete using key and value pair so we can ensure that the correct
            tuple gets deleted (and only delete the first match in case of duplicaters)
    DONE    Add methods to load and save index to disk
    DONE        Make the index have an attribute index name aswell so u dont have to specify the name of the
                index when saving it and modify the save method to use the indexname

DBApp Class:
    DONE       Handle metadata file either by creating a metadata class that deals with it directly or
               triple hashtable method
    DONE     Priority of AND, XOR, OR  should be this order but the TA said AND, OR, XOR

Metadata:
    DONE




DONE handle index changes in update, delete, overflow, insert by creating 2 methods in tupleclass
DONE addDataToAvailableIndices(String tableName, String pageName)
DONE deleteDataFromAvailableIndices(String tableName, String pageName)

FIX: selectFromTable should throw exception if u insert one column with wrong type but then insert it again in another sqlterm with right type as we check using a hashmap so the id is overriden
